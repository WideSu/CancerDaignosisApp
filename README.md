# CancerDaignosisApp
We used CNN to train a breast cancer subtype classifier and did a simple UI interface for it. It's a windows Qt application, you can click to upload a breast HP image, and the app will tell you which type it is, specifically Benign, Normal, Invasive, In Situ.
You can download all the files and run main.py to see the result.
